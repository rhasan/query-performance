work plan
1. query features from sparql algebra for abstract sparql representation, jena arq implements it. use jena arq to exrtact query features from a query
2. generate a dataset by randomly reordering the dbpedia files then redomly selecting a specific number of select type of sparql queries from each file. this will give us a radmonly selected collection of queries. 10,000 would be ok
3. experiment with 1,000 queries. generate execution time and extract query features for each queries.
4. do step 3 in dbpedia-test locally to avoide network transfer time
