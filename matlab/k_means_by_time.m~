% Run your K-Means algorithm on this data
% You should try different values of K and max_iters here
K = 16; 
max_iters = 10;

% When using K-Means, it is important the initialize the centroids
% randomly. 
% You should complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m before proceeding
initial_centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K);

% Run K-Means
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters);
